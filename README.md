I created Vruddy as an open-source Android app, written in Java that is available on GitHub. I developed this app as a way to practice and develop my skills in Android app development. With Vruddy, I aimed to challenge myself. The app is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute, the source code is available on GitHub for other developers to access and contribute to. I hope that Vruddy will be useful for others and that will also serve as a learning experience for me as I continue to improve my skills in app development.
